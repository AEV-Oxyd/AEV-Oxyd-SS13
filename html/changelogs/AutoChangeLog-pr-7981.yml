changes:
  - balance: Increases mech HP/armour values, increases component cost, mechs are
      more time-consuming to repair now, mech treads can't strafe because that was
      OP as f*ck, the power loader/ball chassis can now fit passengers.
  - tweak: Moved exosuits' parts around (no player facing changes.) from the premade
      directory to components.
