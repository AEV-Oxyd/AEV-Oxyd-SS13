changes:
  - balance: FBPs can no longer be turned into grey slimes. Cruciformed humans are
      gibbed but not transformed.
  - bugfix: Implants and prosthetics are not deleted by transforming into a grey slime
      or a slimeperson. They will instead be dropped on the ground.
  - code_imp: added a dropped() implementation for prosthetic limbs
