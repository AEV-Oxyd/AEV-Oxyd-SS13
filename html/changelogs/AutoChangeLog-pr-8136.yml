changes:
  - rscadd: earmuffs to the style vendor
  - rscadd: earmuffs to the asters misc pack disk for autolathe use
  - rscadd: earmuff item sprite (the mob sprite was already added with my other pr,
      I just couldn't find where the item sprite was stored back then. It's from asset-storage).
  - tweak: earmuffs only require one ear to equip
